  aka better ~sleep~ 

  Waits for a specified time. The user can interrupt this. The caller is able to specify a list of keybindings and the returncode they should cause. 

  The idea is that the user can interrupt goat if he knows the condition it is waiting for is already fulfilled. See [[https://github.com/brocode/fbpush][fbpush]].
